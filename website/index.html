			<H2>The Contest</H2></a>
            6.270 is a robotics contest held at MIT every January.&nbsp; The
            goal of 6.270 is to teach students about robotic design by giving
            them the hardware, software, and information they need to design,
            build, and program their own robots.&nbsp; Each team is given a kit
            valued at $1500 which includes LEGOs, a handyboard, and various
            other electronic components.<br>
            <br>
            This year's (2003) competition, &quot;Montezuma's Revenge,&quot;
            involves a three-tiered playing field.&nbsp;
            Robots are placed at the designated starting positions and try to
            collect balls of their own color.&nbsp; If they manage to bring one
            of their balls to rest at the center plateau, they get 1
            point.&nbsp; If they manage to place the ball inside the bucket on
            the lower plateau, they are awarded 4 points.&nbsp; Each round lasts
            for 60 seconds and at the end of the round, the team with the
            highest score wins.

		    <H2>The Name</H2></a>
            We had a hard time thinking of a name for our robot because it went
            through so many different revisions.&nbsp; Since our robot's final
            design looked kind of like a steam shovel, we thought of naming our
            robot &quot;Constructicon&quot;, after the powerful 5-component
            Decepticon in the anime &quot;Transformers.&quot;&nbsp; However, one
            day in lab, somebody started playing &quot;<a href="http://mit.edu/dwtsai/www/kerpal.mp3">kerpal - kick
            dog.mp3</a>&quot;, the infamous prank call that has been floating around
            the Internet for years.&nbsp; Unable to think of a better name, we
            decided to pay homage to the popular mp3 and named our robot &quot;kerpal&quot;.&nbsp;
		    <a name="strategy">
		    <H2>Strategy</H2></a>
            Our robot went for an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; type
            strategy.&nbsp; We decided that since the bin at the bottom of the
            playing field was the jackpot, we should go for it.&nbsp; If we
            manage to score into the bucket, the best our opponent can do is tie
            us with 4 points.&nbsp; We designed our robot to line follow up the
            hill to collect a ball.&nbsp; If we get the enemy's ball dump it and
            try again.&nbsp; When we get our own ball, our robot will then
            line-follow down the hill, turn toward the center of the field, and
            then proceed to dump our ball into the bin.

		    <H2>Our Robot's Design</H2></a>
            Our robot went through at least 6 different revisions before
            settling at its final design.&nbsp; We wanted our robot to be able
            to line follow, so we placed 5 sensors on the bottom (5
            LED/phototransistor pairs).&nbsp; Our robot has two back wheels,
            each driven by a motor.&nbsp; It also has a third, un-driven front
            wheel that is connected to a servo to help with steering and
            balance.&nbsp; The gear train running the back wheels has a 45:1
            gear ratio, which we thought would give our robot a very quick
            speed.<br>
            <br>
            Originally, we rested our handyboard and batteries on a roof on top
            of the robot, but our bot turned out to be too top-heavy.&nbsp; We
            fixed the problem by building a compartment on the left side of the
            robot that could hold the handyboard snugly and a compartment on the
            right side of the robot that could hold the batteries.<br>
            <br>
            The front of our robot was what gave us the most trouble.&nbsp;
            Originally, we wanted a row of spinning tires hanging above a ramp
            that would knock balls in.&nbsp; That didn't work very well, because
            the motor that was attached to the overhanging arm holding the axle
            of tires made the arm bounce vigorously.&nbsp; We had difficulty
            finding a way to gear down the motor, and we also started running
            into the problem of having our robot not fit into the size
            constraints.&nbsp; After playing around with several configurations
            of the tires, we decided to discard the idea and try a new
            one.&nbsp; We
            finally settled on a steam-shovel like design that incorporated a
            long arm/ramp powered by a servo.&nbsp; The servo itself was
            powerful enough to lift the ramp arm, but unfortunately it turned
            out that one servo was not enough to also lift a ball.&nbsp; If the
            ramp had another servo or motor helping it lift the arm, then it
            might actually have been powerful enough to lift a ball.&nbsp;
            Alternatively, we could have tried gearing down the servo to
            sacrifice the servo's 180-degree swivel range to a 90-degree range
            with twice the power.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we ran out of time and
            could not implement a fix.<br>
            <br>
            Had our robot been able to lift a ball, we had a color sensor on the
            ramp itself that would detect whether or not a collected ball was
            one of ours or one of the enemy's.&nbsp; The entire back half of our
            robot is a downward slope so that a ball can roll down the back and
            into a bucket.&nbsp; We had a servo-powered back gate that would
            swivel up and down depending on whether we wanted to keep a ball or
            dump it.

		    <H2>Results</H2></a>
            In Round 1, our team went up against Team 40, &quot;Cortez the
            Killer.&quot;&nbsp; Cortez was designed to go up the hill and grab
            all 4 balls on its side, hoping to get a double-win for both teams
            in the event that their opponent doesn't score.&nbsp; Unfortunately
            for them, they grabbed more of our balls than they did theirs, and
            our team actually ended up having the 3rd-highest score out of all
            60 teams in the round.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our beacon failed to
            turn on in the beginning of the round and we were given a loss via
            disqualification.&nbsp;

		    <a name="analysis">    
		    <H2>Final Analysis</H2></a>
            The main problem that plagued our robot was the one described
            earlier concerning a weak ramp.&nbsp; Essentially, we overestimated
            the power that a servo was able to provide.<br>
            <br>
            Another problem that our robot had was that after we had finished
            construction on the robot, we noticed that it seemed to run out of
            power sometimes as it tried to turn and climb up the hills.&nbsp;
            This is probably due to the 45:1 gear ratio that we employed.&nbsp;
            Originally, we had thought that a 45:1 ratio would give our robot a
            fast speed.&nbsp; However, we underestimated exactly how heavy the
            robot would turn out to be.&nbsp; Furthermore, because we moved our
            handyboard and batteries from the top of the robot to the side
            compartments, the weights were no longer centered over our main gear
            train.&nbsp; I believe we could have fixed this issue by using a
            gear ratio of 75:1 or 90:1, trading in speed for power.
